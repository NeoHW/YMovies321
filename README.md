<center><h1>NUS Orbital 2023 - Milestone 1</h1></center>

### Proposed Level of Achievement:
Project Gemini

### Motivation:
As university students, we have little free time to enjoy ourselves, and given the huge selection of movies available to us, we are spoilt for choice. We all know the feeling of browsing movies only to realise our free time was wasted, or even worse, sat through a boring movie.  
Why not use a local movie review website which is frequented by many other moviegoers of similar ages?

### Aim:  
In order to give student movie buffs a place to find and discuss information about their favourite movies, we want to create a web application. The website's objective is to make it simpler for users to find movies, read reviews, and submit their own evaluations. In doing so, it hopes to foster a community of movie fans who can exchange ideas and suggestions.

### User Stories:

1. I want to be able to search for movies by genre as a university student so that I can find films that interest me.  
2. I want to be able to read user evaluations as a university student so that I may choose movies to watch with knowledge.  
3. I want to be able to rate and review movies as a university student so that I can express my thoughts to other users.  
4. I want to be able to add movies to a watchlist as a university student so that I can remember which ones I want to see later.  
5. I want to be able to make playlists of my favourite movies as a student so that I can quickly access them later.
